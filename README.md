# Sales-Invoice
A practice exercise for 1-M and M-M databases.

4/4
Trying to create a ASP Web Form that will be able to handle 1 to Many and Many to Many database relationships.
The end goal will be to have an invoice generated with the sales person, multiple products, differing qtys, prices for each line, and total price for the invoice.
The majority of this will be handled by SQLite Databases and Dapper Multi-Mapping as this is what I would like to work on.
